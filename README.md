# Summary

Airbnb seems to affect gentriefied areas more, but the number of listings is too small to assume there is an impact of Airbnb on the housing market. The regulations to limit certain types short-term rentals seem not to be fully effective. There are indications, that some hosts could currently still violate this regulations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the regulations, the further development of the Airbnb market in Berlin has to be observed.
